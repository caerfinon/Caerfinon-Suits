Suits for Stock KSP Suit Picker

I'm a big fan of using the Suit Picker to select the look of my Kerbals and mods that provide suits in that format.  
I wanted to make some suits for the "uniforms" of agencies from some of my Contract Pack mods, because I like to tell at a glance 
from crew selction which kerbals are assigned to which agency functions. 

I'm also a big fan of USI Kolonization suits but couldn't find a suit picker version, so I adapted those suit textures to work with the stock suit picker.
