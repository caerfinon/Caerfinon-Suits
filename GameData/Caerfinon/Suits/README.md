# Caerfinon's Suits
Suits for Stock KSP Suit Picker
-------------------------------
I'm a big fan of using the Suit Picker to select the look of my Kerbals and mods that provide suits in that format.  
I wanted to make some suits for the "uniforms" of agencies from some of my Contract Pack mods, because I like to tell at a glance 
from crew selction which kerbals are assigned to which agency functions. 

I'm also a big fan of USI Kolonization suits but couldn't find a suit picker version, so I adapted those suit textures to work with the stock suit picker.  

Notes on IVA Suits
------------------ 
  - If Benjee10's mod is not installed then the IVA portion of the suit config will not be processed
  - All suit definitions use the ACES textures to specify the IVA suits. 
  - USI Kolonization Suits ACES suits are as follows. Non-Veteran suits use the Blue ACES suit, Veteran suits use the Orange ACES Suit
  - Original suits provide their own suitTexture but reference Benjee10's normalTexture

INSTALLATION
------------
Place the contents of GameData/ into your KSP/GameData/ directory and install necessary dependencies.
